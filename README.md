# Voting repo

Repo for vac-week 2025 voting via git

## Phase 1

On an up to date new branch, each team needs to create a json file with their group number that follows the `group-template.json` sample.

Name the file `group-??.json` where the `??` is your group number, e.g. `group-05.json`.

Create a merge request for your team's details.

Once enough people have approved the PR, Rudolph will merge it.

## Phase 2

Each team member should create a new up to date branch, and commit a retrospective (based on the `ExampleRetrospective.md`).

Retrospective files need to be in a folder with the group number, in the same format as the group json. The file-name for your retrospective should be `[your github username].md`

For example, an example restrospective file would be  `group-00/RudolphE-BBD.md`.
