## Biography

Hi! I'm Simon, a final year Computer Science student at Tuks. I enjoy playing around with new frameworks and technologies, especially ones related to web or game development. In my free time you can find me hanging out with friends, wasting my life playing games or working on side projects.

## Highlights

Getting to make new friends and panicking together when everything goes south. There is nothing like shared trauma to bond over. Watching the project come together piece by piece and being able to present something that we can be proud of, regardless of any difficulties.

Learning to work with new technologies is also a big part of the fun, up until this week I had no experience with computer vision, and this has helped me realise that it isn't as intimidating as it first seems.

## Difficulties

Racing against the clock to get everything working as intended, and making sacrifices to our project as we ran out of time. Learning on the fly is a challenge, but a welcome one.

## Recommendations for improvements

As with last year the vac week was fun and a great learning experience, I have no recommendations for improvements.
