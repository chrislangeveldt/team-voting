## Biogrpahy

I am a dedicated final-year Computer Science student at the University of the Free State, passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges. With a strong foundation in programming, software development, and problem-solving, I am eager to launch my career as a software engineer. I am a proactive learner, committed to creating efficient, innovative solutions, and excited to contribute to the tech industry.

## Highlights

Working on the laser tag game with TypeScript, React, and Socket.IO had some exciting highlights. Successfully implementing real-time player movement and laser shot detection using Socket.IO was a big win, creating a thrilling, responsive gameplay experience. Building an engaging UI with React that dynamically rendered the game arena and player stats felt rewarding, especially with smooth animations for hits and score updates. Leveraging TypeScript’s type safety to catch potential bugs early streamlined development and boosted confidence in the codebase. Finally, seeing the game come to life during local testing, with players zipping around and scores updating instantly, was a fun and satisfying moment that made the effort worthwhile.

## Difficulties

Working on a web page with completely technologies that are completely new to me. One major difficulty was managing real-time synchronization of player positions and game states across clients using Socket.IO, as network latency and occasional packet loss led to inconsistent updates. Ensuring smooth rendering of dynamic game elements in React required careful optimization to avoid performance bottlenecks, especially with frequent state updates. TypeScript’s strict typing, while helpful, added complexity when integrating with Socket.IO’s loosely typed events, requiring custom type definitions. Debugging real-time interactions was also tricky, as race conditions and timing issues were hard to replicate consistently. Despite these hurdles, the project was a great learning experience in balancing real-time communication and front-end performance.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

I believe I would have benefited more if we had more learning time to get a better understanding of what we are working on since everything was pretty much new to me.
