## Biogrpahy

I am Gwendeline, often referred to as Gwen. I am currently completing my Honours in Informatics at the University of Pretoria. I am interested in the Business Analyst role and have an interest in building solutions that will meet the client's needs and solve their business problem. Logical designing is where I thrive. My research paper focuses on IoT dark data; outlining strategies that organisations can use to extract value from dark data. 

## Highlights

It was enlightening to meeting different people from different institutions and different backgrounds with a vast of skills and knowledge that is different from mine. Also, being in the office gave an idea of the culture of the company. 

## Difficulties

As an Informatics student, there is very limited programming in my course. We have done C# and Angular in my undergraduate studies and there is no programming in Honours. Therefore, I have some knowledge of programming but it is limited. My team chose to work with React which is something very foreign for me and it was difficult learning about it in 3-4 days. 

## Reccomendations for imptovements

Vac Work Week is beneficial for those that are interested in going the Software Developer route but adds little value for those of us interested in going the Business Analyst route. I understand a good Business Analyst needs an understanding of the technical aspects as well. However, I think an additional task that included the direct duties of a Business Analyst would have been beneficial. Everything else went well. Thank you for the experience.
