**Attendee Type:** BBD Bursar


## Biography

I am a tech enthusiast who enjoys gaming(Whichever catagory of games).



## Highlights

- My biggest highlight was getting the marker detection working because our team had everything else working except the detector so we needed the relieve
- I also learnt websockets which was nice



## Difficulties

- Websockets was infact not nice, I had a bit of a struggle integrating with the frontend.
- Getting everyone to work on one thing at a time was a bit challenging, time was lost integrating multiple branches with overlapping code.

## Recommendations for Improvements

- Like the December/Jan vac work, a mini project would be nice as other bursars did not know about react and even git.
