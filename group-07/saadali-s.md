## Biography  
Final-year computer science student. Enjoy building things, solving problems, and figuring stuff out as I go. Took part in the 2025 BBD Vacation Work programme to get a feel for working in a real dev environment.

## Highlights  
Working with a team on a real project was a cool experience — especially seeing things actually come together under pressure. Learned a lot about Git workflows, teamwork, and how to break down tasks properly. Also appreciated seeing how other groups tackled similar challenges in different ways.

## Difficulties  
Getting started was a bit rough with setup and figuring out what the project needed. Some confusion at times about who’s doing what, and it took a bit to get the team in sync. Short timeframe made it a bit stressful near the end, but we pulled through.

## Recommendations for Improvements  
Maybe have a quick walkthrough of the repo or setup instructions on Day 1 — that would save time and confusion. A daily check-in with a mentor would also help keep teams unblocked. More time at the start for planning would make a big difference.
