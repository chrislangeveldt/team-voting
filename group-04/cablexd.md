## Biogrpahy

I am a first year computer science student at the University of Pretoria who loves working on personal projects and learning to use new technologies. At the age of 12, I dived into the world of game development and have since used many different languages, APIs, and frameworks. My passion for coding continues growing to this day.

## Highlights

I've always wanted to work in a team of other developers where each person works on a component of the project to later make the components work together for a final product. I was able to do that this week which was definitely my highlight. Being able to collaborate with others and discuss the technologies we were using was very exciting.

## Difficulties

The first two days of development were great, and we were productive. However, we ran into an issue on day three involving our websocket and passing data between react pages. We spent many hours trying to fix this issue and eventually decided to remove the websocket functionality on that page altogether. Fixing that problem was not fun.

Our color identification system is also not very accurate, and we struggled to make it work better.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

The breakfasts could be improved - most of the items served were sweet which makes the variety feel fairly limited.

Otherwise, the VAC week was very enjoyable, and I had a fantastic first experience.
