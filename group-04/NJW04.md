## Biogrpahy

I will only speak about this year. I am doing computer science honours at UCT working with data driven control and applying RL algorithms like PPO to systems like the inverted pendulum. I hate Matlab. I like to game and gym.

## Highlights

I enjoy hackathons and this week was basically a hackathon so that was my highlight

## Difficulties

The hardest part of this week was surviving with no water.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

This was my first year and I enjoyed it, I guess maybe they could just outright say what they don't want, because they clearly didn't want QR codes lol.
