Attendee Type: BBD Bursar

## Biography

I am 3rd year student at the University of Stellenbosch. I have been a bursar since 2023, so this was my third BBD-Vac week. I plan to pursue postgraduate studies next year. I enjoy programming (what a suprise). I have a <span style="color:green">green</span> toothbrush.
. My CV is available on request, feel free to email [me](mailto:michael.bruwer.swartz@gmail.com).

## Highlights

- Computer Vision: As someone who has never had experience with Computer Vision it was cool learning how to use it, even if my original understanding of how I should use computer vision was veto'd by Rudolph.
- Environment: Got to meet alot of new people form my University and others. Could discuss potential future module decisions with them and they offered great guidance towards my future. Meeting people from other universisities was great as I got to learn how Computer Science, and more generally the field of prorgamming, can be viewed in different ways.

## Difficulties

- When swithing from a simple openCV model that detects shapes to a more complex tensorflow model that detects humans and rigs them we had alot of interation problems. This stemmed from the way our lobby system originally worked and how long it took for tensorflow to successfully load, causing lots of issues. Was a lowlight of the week when it was happening but now retrospectively I've learnt how to tackle these problems in future.
- Color identification and testing was tedious as small environmental changes would drastically change the computer vision functionality.

## Recomendations for improvements

- To make it more effective: In the invite emails mention that you should be very capable with using basic git atleast.
- Force groups to use vanilla javascript, React not fun :(
- I already found it very fun, so no further recommendations.
- As someone living the vantage a less sweat breakfast would be nice sometimes ;)
