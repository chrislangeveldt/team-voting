## Biogrpahy

I am a second-year Computer Science student from South Africa, driven by the mission to use artificial intelligence to solve global challenges. I am actively building a portfolio through academic projects, including complex AI systems such as a survival-mode snake game featuring advanced pathfinding and heuristic-based decision-making.

I am building research experience, aiming to contribute to open-source software and competitive hackathons. My technical foundation includes Python, C/C++, Java and a little tiny bit of JS, with a growing interest in scalable system design and applied deep learning.

## Highlights

When main become main again.

## Difficulties

Communication, I should have taught other team members how to use PRs on the first day.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

No more JS.
