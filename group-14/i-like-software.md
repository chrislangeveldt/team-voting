Attendee Type: UFS Attendee

## Biogrpahy

Third year Computer Science Student at UFS

## Highlights

Learning how to use GitHub. Learning how to use the terminal/ command prompt. Learning how to use React. Learning Javascript. Learning Typescript. Learning how to host web applications.
Learning how computer vision works. TLDR I learnt a lot and although I havent mastered anything it was a good first step

## Difficulties

Not knowing any of the languages and frameworks we were using and having to learn while also trying to constructively contribute to the project

## Reccomendations for imptovements

Do the project in phases, where each day the team has to submit one part of the project i.e. the computer vision logic, then the backend, then the frontend, then the full project. I think that approach will allow the whole team to learn about all parts of the project.
