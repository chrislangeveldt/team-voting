## Biogrpahy

I am a final-year international student from Zimbabwe studying at the University of the Free State (UFS).I am studying data science and am very passionate about data analytics and all its applications.

## Highlights

It was my first time working on a project and in a group. I did not know most of things we were doing and my groups mates were willing to teach me. I can say  l did more of learning this week because l have never used github before, i have never used javascript before and it was my first time learning about sockets.
