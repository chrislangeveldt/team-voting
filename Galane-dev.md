## Biogrpahy

I'm Welcome Galane, Im a student at UFS doing third year in IT. I have a strong passion for problem solving, and because of that i have been on a journey of developing impactful projects that address problems people face daily. Besides programming I enjoy working out and playing games, be it indegenous or digital.

## Highlights

Learning how sockets work. 
My team having the first working demo of the shooter game that was able to communicate and handle events
And also realizing that git is complicated.

## Difficulties

Working with people on github, because i had to learn branches and lot of complicated git stuff

## Reccomendations for imptovements

Even though you don't tell us the project beforehand, tell us the possible tech stack we might have to use, because we kinda feel useless if we can't contribute to some stuff if we are still learning
