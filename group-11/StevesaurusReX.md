## Biogrpahy

My name is Stefann Lötter but my friends just call me Steve. I am aspiring software developer who first fell in love with problem solving when
I got introduced to the world of computer programming by my dad. I am currently a NSFAS student at UFS doing a bsc in Computer Science and business management and I'm in my third and final year. I hope to study as far as I can so that I can get the oppertunity of a lifetime to actually what I love and what makes me passionate for my daily job and support my mother financially as she's given me everything she could to support me and my dreams I hope that one day I can give a fraction back to her. I love programming even though I have a huge case of imposter syndrome I feel that even though I get grood grades with a above 77% average I haven't really built any projects on my own and after this vac week at BBD it reignited my passion I am now more motivated than ever to actually start building and learning things. I have some catching up to do to get up to date with my peers but I am hardworking and persistent if not anything else!

## Highlights

My biggest highlight of the week was learning about version control especially and other tech stacks like Node.js and the Javascript library in general. I find it awesome that you can create a fulltsack project using javascript for a language made in only 10 days I find it awesome. The best part was coming together and figuring out how to build the project and working together as a team.

## Difficulties

I am a socially awkward and shy person so talking to and collaborating with strangers was always challenging for me and I know that's not good going into being a software dev as I need to talk to clinets from all over the world but luckily my team ws very frinedly and valued  alearning and sharing environment so I learned so much over these past 3 days it was awesome.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

Uhm... I don't know I'm just happy to be here.
