## Biogrpahy



I'm a 24 year old young woman, born and raised in KZN, to my lovely parents Mr and Mrs Nondabula. With more than 7 people in the house, it was never silent, there was always a riff raff with my grandmother siblings and cousins around. I went to an all girl's school from grade 2 to matric, my parents thought it was a great method to keep me focussed on academics. Did I always want to be a programmer? No, my interest in programming began when I was studying a different degree, civil engineering to be specific. With a passionate dislike for civil engineering and it reciprocating it's passionate dislike for me I dared to begin again which is how I got here I guess.



## Highlights



My highlight of the week was learning. I didn't know how to build a web application, I didn't even know Javascipt. This week also taught me not to be afraid to say I don't know and to not leave it at "I don't know" but to ask for help and do research.



## Difficulties

I had a lot of difficulties with having to learn new things and implement them in a short amount of time.



## Reccomendations for imptovements



I don't have any rec recommendations for improvements, I had a good time.
