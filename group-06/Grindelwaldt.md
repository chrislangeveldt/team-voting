## Highlights

1) It was extremely gratifying when we got the application deployed and it was working :D.
2) Learning about web applications and implementing one was more enjoyable than I expected XD.
3) The office facilities were quite impressive, and I found myself enjoying both the office and location.

## Difficulties

1) Trying to make an informed decision about what tech stack to use as no one in our group had ever developed or deployed a web application prior to this week. 
2) Teaching all of my group members how Git and Javascript work to make it possible for them to contribute.

## Reccomendations for imptovements

1) What is imptovements? Instructions unclear.
2) When inviting 1st timers to the vac week you can request for them to learn Git and basic Javascript before they attend the vac week, as this would make collaboration from day one easier.
3) If possible, try and limit the use of AI. I found that my group members relied on AI to the point that they were not learning how to actually program independently of it. That is they were unable to execute any instruction without either me or AI guiding them on where and how to do it.
