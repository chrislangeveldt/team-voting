## Biogrpahy

Aged 21 from johannesburg Tembisa, studying computer sciences at the University of Free State doing my 3rd year.

## Highlights

Highlights of the week was working on the shooting/laser tag game. I learned quite a few new things and had the chance to meet some great people at BBD. The experience was good. 

## Difficulties
My main challenges were getting started with GitHub and using it safely to not negatively affect my group main work, and understanding the computer vision part of the project I had to work on.


## Reccomendations for imptovements

To make the vacation week more fun and enjoyable, I recommend informing us in advance about the programming languages and platforms we will be using. Personally most of the tools were new to me, which limited my ability to fully contribute to every part of the group project.
